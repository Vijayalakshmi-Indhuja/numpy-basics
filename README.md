# NumPy Basics – Hands-on Practice

This repository contains a comprehensive **NumPy practice notebook** designed to build strong fundamentals for **Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and Machine Learning** roles.

The notebook includes practical examples, exercises, and demonstrations of NumPy concepts commonly tested in technical interviews.

---

## 📌 Topics Covered

- NumPy array creation (`array`, `arange`, `eye`)
- Array dimensions (0D, 1D, 2D, 3D)
- Shape, data types, and attributes
- List vs NumPy array performance comparison
- Indexing and slicing (1D, 2D, 3D)
- Reshaping arrays (1D → 2D → 3D)
- Flattening arrays
- Copy vs View (memory sharing)
- Stack operations (`hstack`, `vstack`)
- Concatenation, append, insert, delete operations

---

## 🚀 Why NumPy?

NumPy provides fast, vectorized operations and efficient memory management, making it a core library for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.

This notebook demonstrates **why NumPy is faster than Python lists** using performance benchmarking.
